# ABSTRACT: Log::Any proxy to upgrade string errors to objects with stack traces

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Any qw( $log, proxy_class => 'WithStackTrace' );

  # Allow stack trace call stack arguments to be logged:
  use Log::Any qw( $log, proxy_class => 'WithStackTrace',
                         proxy_show_stack_trace_args => 1 );

  # Configure some adapter that knows how to:
  #  1) handle structured data, and
  #  2) handle message objects which have a "stack_trace" method:
  Log::Any::Adapter->set($adapter);

  $log->error("Help!");   # stack trace gets automatically added,
                          # starting from this line of code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some log adapters, like L<Log::Any::Adapter::Sentry::Raven>, are able to
take advantage of being passed message objects that contain a stack
trace.  However if a stack trace is not available, and fallback logic is
used to generate one, the resulting trace can be confusing if it begins
relative to where the log adapter was called, and not relative to where
the logging method was originally called.

With this proxy in place, if any logging method is called with a log
message that is a non-reference scalar (i.e. a string), that log message
will be upgraded into a C<Log::Any::MessageWithStackTrace> object with a
C<stack_trace> method, and that method will return a trace relative to
where the logging method was called.  A string overload is provided on
the object to return the original log message.

Additionally, any call stack arguments in the stack trace will be
deleted before logging, to avoid accidentally logging sensitive data.
This happens both for message objects that were auto-generated from
string messages, as well as for message objects that were passed in
directly (if they appear to have a stack trace method).  This default
argument scrubbing behavior can be turned off by specifying a true value
for the C<proxy_show_stack_trace_args> import flag.

B<Important:> This proxy should be used with a L<Log::Any::Adapter> that
is configured to handle structured data.  Otherwise the object created
here will just get stringified before it can be used to access the stack
trace.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 maybe_upgrade_with_stack_trace

  @args = $self->maybe_upgrade_with_stack_trace(@args);

This is an internal-use method that will convert a non-reference scalar
message into a C<Log::Any::MessageWithStackTrace> object with a
C<stack_trace> method.  A string overload is provided to return the
original message.

Stack trace args are scrubbed out in case they contain sensitive data,
unless the C<proxy_show_stack_trace_args> option has been set.

sub maybe_upgrade_with_stack_trace
{
    my ($self, @args) = @_;

    # We expect a message, optionally followed by a structured data
    # context hashref.  Bail if we get anything other than that rather
    # than guess what the caller might be trying to do:
    return @args unless   @args == 1 ||
                        ( @args == 2 && ref $args[1] eq 'HASH' );

    if (ref $args[0]) {
        $self->maybe_delete_stack_trace_args($args[0])
            unless $self->{proxy_show_stack_trace_args};
    }
    else {
        $args[0] = Log::Any::MessageWithStackTrace->new(
            $args[0],
            no_args => !$self->{proxy_show_stack_trace_args},
        );
    }

    return @args;
}

=head2 maybe_delete_stack_trace_args

  $self->maybe_delete_stack_trace_args($arg);

This is an internal-use method that, given a single argument that is a
reference, tries to figure out whether the argument is an object with a
stack trace, and if so tries to delete any stack trace args.

The logic is based on L<Devel::StackTrace::Extract>.

It specifically looks for objects with a C<stack_trace> method (which
should catch anything that does L<StackTrace::Auto>, including anything
that does L<Throwable::Error>), or a C<trace> method (used by
L<Exception::Class> and L<Moose::Exception> and friends).

It specifically ignores L<Mojo::Exception> objects, because their stack
traces don't contain any call stack args.

=head2 delete_args_from_stack_trace($trace)

  $self->delete_args_from_stack_trace($trace)

To scrub potentially sensitive data from C<Devel::StackTrace> arguments,
this method deletes arguments from all of the C<Devel::StackTrace::Frame>
in the trace.
