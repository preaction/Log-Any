Revision history for Log-Any

** denotes an incompatible change

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Fixed]

    - Log::Any::Adapter::Test passed through all constructor arguments,
      which could be fatal when mocking adapters without all key-value
      pairs (like Log::Any::Adapter::File); now this only passes through
      the category and ignores other parameters.

1.03      2015-01-01 22:39:41-05:00 America/New_York

    [Changed]

    - Log::Any::Proxy concatenates arguments to basic logging functions
      with a space character before passing them to adapters as a single
      string.  This ensures consistency across adapters that handle
      multiple arguments differently.

1.02      2014-12-28 07:06:49-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - Some adapters relied on Log::Any::Adapter::Util also loading
      Log::Any so this behavior has been restored.

1.01      2014-12-26 22:25:13-05:00 America/New_York

    [Fixed]

    - 'numeric_level' was not exported properly from
      Log::Any::Adapter::Util

1.00      2014-12-25 22:04:13-05:00 America/New_York

    [Added]

    - Logging now goes via a Log::Any::Proxy object instead of directly to
      an adapter. This allows easy customization of the message production.

    - File, Stdout, and Stderr adapters now support a minimum
      log level parameter.

    [Changed]

    - Removed dead code from Log::Any::Adapter::Base; particularly this
      was the formatting code, since this is now handled by
      Log::Any::Proxy.

    [Fixed]

    - File will flock the handle when writing (if flock is avaiable).

    - Won't die if adapters aren't loadable modules as long as they
      provide a constructor.  This allows using private adapters
      defined in another file.

    [Documented]

    - Revised docs for creating adapters

    - Fixed typos and improved docs for Log::Any::Adapter::Util; removed
      stub docs for modules that didn't need it.

    [Deprecated]

    - Deprecated some methods in Log::Any::Adapter::Util

    [Internal]

    - Merged Log-Any and Log-Any-Adapter distributions; reduces code
      duplication and ensures Log::Any and adapter framework stay in sync

    - Eliminates all non-core dependencies (as of Perl 5.8.1), including
      Capture::Tiny, Devel::GlobalDestruction and Guard

0.05  Oct 27, 2009

    unchanging. Move everything else to Log::Any::Adapter.

0.04  Sep 3, 2009

* Fixes
  - Replace Test::Deep::cmp_deeply with an internal version to avoid Test::Deep dependency

0.03  Jul 17, 2009
