Revision history for Log-Any

** denotes an incompatible change

{{ $NEXT }}

    [Deprecated]

    - Deprecated some methods in Log::Any::Adapter::Util

    [Documented]

    - Revised docs for creating adapters

0.91      2014-12-14 22:13:09-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Changed]

    - Removed dead code from Log::Any::Adapter::Base; particularly this
      was the formatting code, since this is now handled by
      Log::Any::Proxy.

    [Documented]

    - Fixed typos and improved docs for Log::Any::Adapter::Util; removed
      stub docs for modules that didn't need it.

0.90      2014-12-12 17:08:22-05:00 America/New_York (TRIAL RELEASE)

    [Added]

    - Logging now goes via a Log::Any::Proxy object instead of directly to
      an adapter. This allows easy customization of the message production.

    [Internal]

    - Merged Log-Any and Log-Any-Adapter distributions; reduces code
      duplication and ensures Log::Any and adapter framework stay in sync

    - Eliminates all non-core dependencies (as of Perl 5.8.1), including
      Capture::Tiny, Devel::GlobalDestruction and Guard

    me wince every time.
